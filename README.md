# Why didn't I just use the existing connector?
This small project is my solution to a problem I came across when trying to access multiple WCF-services
from a new ASP.NET Core project and could not get the official WCF-extension to properly create
the interfaces.

Most of the examples found by simple googling came up with simple connector implementations. These did not
showcase the actual problem and were lacking in situations where multiple connections are needed. The aim here
is to create a generic, yet simple, way to handle such a situation.

# What else is this solution good for?
The connected service reference is tied to one endpoint and to my knowledge the endpoint cannot be changed on the fly.
Most web applications have multiple environments where they are run, so naturally the endpoints of WCF services will
also change depending on the use case, ex. Production / Development implementations.

This Wcf proxy approach makes it possible to configure the endpoint in a configuration file and then configure the
client itself to connect to this url, instead of using multiple separate connected service references.

# Problem description
The first step in trying to enable WCF-services is to use the official Visual Studio extension found here:

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/06/26/wcf-connected-service-for-net-core-1-0-0-and-asp-net-core-1-0-0-is-now-available/

The WCF Connected service for .NET Core 3.1 should fit to most use cases, but the library is not compatible with more complex (or incorrectly configured) services. You might face an error similar to the following, in such a case, the best option is to connect programmatically to the service via a proxy class library. This repository shows one way to
implement this approach.

```
Scaffolding Code â€¦
Error:Error: No endpoints compatible with .Net Core apps were found.
An error occurred in the tool.

Failed to generate service reference. 
```
# Solution
1. Services are implemented in WcfServices
2. WcfProxy project uses service references to create service contracts
3. Wrapper classes in WcfProxy-project mask the actual services implementations and instad call them through the Proxy-class.
4. Wrapper maps the Dtos to separate model classes
5. ASP.NET Core injects the wrappers where they are used

The Wcf services are completely isolated from the ASP.NET implementation and no references are needed to WcfServices-project.

# Running the solution
```
git clone https://github.com/jolmari/netcore-wcf-service-proxy.git
```
1. Download the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK & Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
2. Open the solution [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
3. Build solution
4. Open the NetCoreWebApp project, open context menu on references and restore packages
5. Run the solution (Ctrl+F5/F5)

# This project includes:

* Multiple WCF services
   * Simple examples of WCF services that are connected to by the proxy-class via message contracts.
   * IoC using built-in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection.

* WCF-proxy implementation
   * A class library project that wraps the actual service contracts with proxy implementations

* ASP.NET Core client that calls is used to demonstrate the use cases

## Troubleshooting
1. The services don't start:
  * Solution Explorer -> Solution -> Properties -> Startup Project. Start WcfServices & NetCoreWebApp.
